# Uber-Vs-For-Hire-Vehicle
 The purpose of this study is to examine Uber and other for-hire vehicle (FHV) pick-up data in New York City. We will be able to make decisions based on the results of the analysis. A descriptive and exploratory study was conducted to compare Uber pickups against other for-hire cars.

The final outcome for the data analysis showed a pattern where we can analyse how they are normalised

The normalisation enhances the visibility of defined groups in travel patterns. Depending on this research, I divided the companies into three categories based on their weekday trips pattern. I have formed groups to explain the trends and patterns.

Group 1. Yellow Taxis, Uber, and Firstclass: Quiet Sundays, Busy Saturdays.

Thursday or Friday are the busiest days. Except for Mondays, working days are pretty comparable in demand. Sundays and Mondays are calm days for this group.

Group 2. Skyline, Carmel, and Dial7: Quiet Saturday and Sunday(Weekends)

Working days have comparably similar demand. Thurday is a peak day for this group of companies and has quite weekends.

Group 3. Green Taxis, Lyft, Prestige, Highclass, Diplo, and American: Busy weekends.

This group has a very busy weekends and is quite during the weekdays.

Different pricing models are most likely to blame for these phenomena. For example, after analysis we can say that group 2 may provide weekend discounts to entice its clients. To have a better understanding on impact of pricing model, more information or data on trip pricing might help.

CONCLUSION

The analysis can be improved by gaining more recent infomation of data. Furthermore, the analysis and insights can be improved if we have more data. Event, weather, fuel pricing can be added with the dataset to gain better knowledge on the trips patterns and trends.
